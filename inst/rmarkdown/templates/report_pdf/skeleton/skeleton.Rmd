Introduction
============

This famous iris data set, collected by Anderson [@anderson:1936] and used by Fisher [@fisher:1936], gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. They are extremely similar species of iris, but do have some blank differences. In Plot 1 we give images of the three iris species. 

Description of Data
==================

This dataset has 1 categorical variable and 4 quantitative variables. Whether a variable is the explanatory variable or the dependent variable may depend on the model being considered motivated by some question of interest. Before looking at any models, we want to get familiar with the data. In the very least, we will want to summarize the data either with plots or with summary statistics. The first few lines of the dataset are given below:

```{r xtabhead, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
print(xtable(iris[1:7,], 
             align = rep("c",6), 
             caption = "First 7 rows of the dataset"),
      include.rownames = FALSE
      )
```

First, let's explore the whole dataset. We can print summary tables by each variable using the stargazer function out of a package by the same name. This is the output:

\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\label{datasummary}
```{r dataset, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
stargazer(iris, float = FALSE, iqr = TRUE)
```
\caption{Caption here}
\end{table}

In Table \ref{datasummary}, we see the summary output of each variable. We also may want to subset our data by species and look at summary statistics. Consider the beanplot's below.

We can also visualize these summary statistics with a box-plot. The box-plot given in Figure blank

```{r bplot1, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(3,4,2,2))
boxplot(iris[,1:4])
```

In Table 2 we see the summary output of each variable. We also may want to subset our data by species and look at summary statistics. Consider the beanplot's below.

```{r sep, fig.width = 8, fig.height=8, fig.show='hold', htmlcap="<b>Figure 1</b>: An interesting Figure Caption", echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
beanplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, ylab = "Sepal Length", xlab = "Species", col = "beige", method = "jitter")
beanplot(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data = iris, ylab = "Sepal Width", xlab = "Species", col = "beige", method = "jitter")
beanplot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, ylab = "Petal Length", xlab = "Species", col = "beige", method = "jitter")
beanplot(Petal.Width ~ Species, data = iris, ylab = "Petal Width", xlab = "Species", col = "beige", method = "jitter")
```

Though this marginal information may be useful in an analysis, when exploring multivariate data such as this we may want to consider some pair-wise relationships

We can see in Figure blank that a clear relationship between sepal width and sepal length. We also see that this relationship may differ by species of iris.

A Simple Regression
===================

To explore the relationship we observed in figure blank, we will build a regression model. We can write out the relationship as:

$$ Sepal Length = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Sepal Width + \beta_2 Sepal Width \times  $$

```{r chunk2, echo = FALSE}
lm1 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width * Species, data = iris)
lm2 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Species, data = iris)
lm3 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width , data = iris)
lm4 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```


We get the following model summary output. 

```{r chunk3, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
print(xtable(summary(lm1), 
             align = rep("c",5), 
             caption = "A descriptive caption"),
      include.rownames = TRUE
      )
```


In Table blank, we see that 

We can also conduct an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to test 


We might wonder if we need to model the interaction term

```{r anova, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
print(xtable(anova(lm1), 
             align = rep("c",6), 
             caption = "A descriptive caption"),
      include.rownames = TRUE
      )
```

We can see from the ANOVA output that there isn't much evidence that the slope of the relationship between Sepal Width and Sepal Length differs by species. We might then test the additive effects. We give type II sums of squares in the additive model to get two tests we are interested in.

```{r anova2, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
print(xtable(Anova(lm2, type = "II"), 
             align = rep("c",5), 
             caption = "A descriptive caption"),
      include.rownames = TRUE
      )
```

We see that the additive model seems appropriate. The diagnostic plots for this model are given in table

```{r diagnostic2, echo = FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', fig.show='hold'}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm1)
```
